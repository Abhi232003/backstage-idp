# Bitbucket Workflows

This directory contains Bitbucket-specific files for the ${{ values.component_id }} service.

## Current Files

- `setup-branches.sh` - Script to set up environment branches (dev, staging, main)

## Future Additions

The following files will be added in future updates:

- **Bitbucket Pipelines**: CI/CD configuration files for automated testing and deployment
- **Deployment Scripts**: Platform-specific deployment automation
- **Branch Management**: Additional tools for Bitbucket branch protection and policies

## Usage

After creating your repository, run the setup script:

```bash
chmod +x setup-branches.sh
./setup-branches.sh
```

This will create the necessary environment branches and provide guidance for setting up Bitbucket-specific configurations.
